[00:04.48] Hey little apple blossom
[00:08.30] What seems to be the problem?
[00:13.08] All the ones you tell your troubles to
[00:16.73] They don't really care for you
[00:31.73] 
[00:20.52] Come and tell me what you're thinking
[00:24.09] 'Cause just when the boat is sinking
[00:28.58] A little light is blinking
[00:32.10] And I will come and rescue you
[00:47.10] 
[00:36.31] Lots of girls walk around in tears
[00:39.96] But that's not for you
[00:43.73] You've been looking all around for years
[00:46.27] For someone to tell your troubles to
[01:04.27] 
[00:51.03] Come and sit with me and talk a while
[00:54.85] Let me see your pretty little smile
[00:58.55] Put your troubles in a little pile
[01:01.69] And I will sort 'em out for you (alright)
[01:22.19] 
[01:35.38] Lots of girls walk around in tears
[01:39.16] But that's not for you
[01:42.98] You've been looking all around for years
[01:45.86] For someone to tell your troubles to
[02:03.86] 
[01:50.53] Come and sit with me and talk a while
[01:54.21] Let me see your pretty little smile
[01:57.85] Put your troubles in a little pile
[02:01.05] And I will sort 'em out for you
[02:16.55] 
[02:05.09] I'll fall in love with you
[02:08.76] I think I'll marry you
