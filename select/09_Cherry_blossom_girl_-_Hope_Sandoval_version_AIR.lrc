[00:12.84] I don't think I feel like being shy
[00:25.11] Don't think I wanna stand here anymore
[00:37.85] I just wanna say, "Hi" to the one I love
[00:50.68] Tell my cherry blossom girl, this is true
[01:11.18] 
[01:11.44] I never talk to you
[01:17.37] People say I should
[01:25.05] I just wanna go out
[01:30.59] And go for it
[01:37.09] 
[01:37.42] Just wanna be sure you'll be by my side
[01:50.46] Tell my cherry blossom girl, this is true
[02:05.27] This is true
[02:11.75] This is true
